### The food

Usually Six Nations Food is about taking two things that would not normally go together, and finding a way to merge them into an unusual but exciting new combination. However this one was slightly different, celebrating two dishes that come from different places with completely different food cultures, but whose paths must surely have crossed at some point in history.

Cassoulet is a French classic. The legend goes that it was invented by necessity in the 14th century while the country was under seige by the English and they kind of needed to chuck whatever they had into a pot in order to sustain themselves. However the [Great Brotherhood of the Cassoulet](https://www.confrerieducassoulet.com/l-histoire.html)[^1] are a bit scornful about that, and tell the story as a gradual evolution over many centuries from a 7th century middle eastern import to the cassoulet we know today. Recipes vary but it is basically a stew of sausages, bacon and beans, sometimes encompassing a bit of duck or goose. Chuck it all in the oven for a couple of hours.
[^1]: <sub>They really are bonkers for cassoulet in the brotherhood. See also the equally bonkers [Universal Cassoulet Academy](http://www.academie-du-cassoulet.com/), complete with their own anthem and embassies (two, to date).</sub> 

Just as cassoulet was coming into its own in the 18th century, another similar dish was finding its way into households and taverns in Dublin - Coddle. A stew of sausages and bacon, cooked slowly for a couple of hours in the oven, but with potatoes rather than beans (of course!). Maybe it's just a coincidence, and the French did not actually invent the idea of chucking some sausages in a pot. But the name even [comes from a French word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coddle) - *caudle* - which means to simmer.

There are no societies dedicated to glorifying the Coddle, which is much less famous than Irish stew. It is namedropped in literature but [its recipe is rarely chronicled](https://www.britishfoodinamerica.com/Our-First-Irish-Number/the-lyrical/A-note-about-Dublin-coddle/#.Y-VnZ3bP02w), and it is maybe even a bit looked down on. One thing that might put people off is that there's no imperative to brown the ingredients, so it might end up looking a bit watery and anemic, although you can brown them and it seems many [prefer it that way](https://dublininquirer.com/2017/08/16/white-brown-or-black-the-debate-over-dublin-coddle). The lack of love for coddle is a shame because we actually found it to be quite delicious - especially with a few French tweaks.

We started with a basic coddle recipe - sausages (basic but good quality pork ones from the butcher), bacon, onions, carrots, potatoes. We **did** brown the sausages, and fried off the bacon, onions and carrots - with some garlic for added French-ness. Then went in some chopped potatoes, plus a few more French additions - some parsley, bay leaves, haricot beans, and white wine (from Carcassone, home of the cassoulet). It simmered away for about an hour.

Even when you brown things, it's not the most beautiful looking dish in the world, but it tasted sensational. It's probably due to all the fat from the sausages and bacon leeching into the cooking liquid, but all the vegetables come out tasting amazing, especially the potatoes, which were creamy and practically melting. This one is going to find itself back on the list very soon - we won't wait till the next six nations.
