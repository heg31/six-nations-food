## What's the deal?
Rugby + food = win. Throw in some fusion cookery silly-ness and you've got yourself a hobby/obsession.

## How does it work?
For any six nations match, pick a dish or ingredient from each of the two nations involved, and create a new and exciting fusion of the two, to consume during the match. Sweet or savoury, probably not one of each although don't rule anything out.

## Does this actually work?
Some combinations work better than others. Really winning combos can be found under the [top scorers tag](/tags/topscorers).
