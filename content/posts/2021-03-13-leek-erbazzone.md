### The food

I'd discovered this Italian Food blog while looking for inspiration for another match and [Erbazzone](https://memoriediangelina.com/2018/04/14/erbazzone/) was one of the first dishes that jumped out as having potential for a mash up. The 'crazy dough' was pretty straightforward to make and easy to work with. Apparently the name stems from it being crazy simple rather than crazy mad.

For our filling we used leeks as well as Swiss chard, pancetta and garlic. It was enriched with Black Bomber cheddar instead of Parmesan.

Although the top was pricked all over it still puffed up a bit, so the holes maybe need to be a little bigger if we make it again. It came away from the dish easily and didn't have a soggy bottom.

A very tasty pie with a light and crisp pastry and nice filling, perfect for a lunchtime match.
