### The game

**Date:** 13th February 2021
**Who was playing:** England v Italy
**What was the score:** 41-18

### The food

Italians are not renowned for being relaxed about their national cuisine. Witness the horror captured by this [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ItalianComments) at crimes against their national dishes, such as bamboo shoots on a pizza ("what are you, a panda?"), and pasta with rice ("I suggest an exorcism"). To be fair the examples chronicled there are almost universally horrible, but you'll get a pretty similar reaction even to a perfectly tasty spag bol, or a request for parmesan on your pasta *al salmone*, or really any recipe that is not exactly how their dear old *Nonna* made it.

One item that is absolutely not for messing around with is the piadina. It's not just any old unleavened flatbread, no signore. Its PGI certification means that it has to be made in the Romagna region of Italy, to a specific recipe and method, or it just aint a piadia. There's even a [Consortium for the Defence and Promotion of Piadina Romagnola](http://www.consorziopiadinaromagnola.it/en/the-consortium/) to keep an eye on any imposters creeping on to the market, and celebrate this humble snack in a way that only a truly food obsessed nation can.

Presumably the version I attempted previously does not count as a true piadina, seeing as it was made in sunny Yorkshire, and I'm pretty sure I did not use the [regulation quantity of lard](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52014XC0521(02)&from=LV). It's merely an Italian style flatbread. Oh well, it was kind of a faff anyway (I've never got much joy out of making bready things), and happily you can buy something that is allowed to call itself a piadina in UK supermarkets. Which is what we did for this match.

Oddly enough, despite being extremely specific on the bread aspect, the Italians seem fairly relaxed about [what goes in it](http://www.ilariasperfectrecipes.com/piadina-romagnola-best-authentic-italian-flatbread/). Jam? Nutella? No problem! The savoury types are generally some combination of cured meat, soft cheese and perhaps some green vegetables. Not today though. Today we wanted something quintessentially English, so we went for a good old butchers sausage, with slow cooked onions, sharp cheddar, and a smearing of English mustard.

The result was most pleasant; sausagey, oniony goodness, encased in a soft, warm Italian flatbread. A perfect accompaniment to an early Italian try, which raised the tantalising possibility of a second embarrassment at Twickenham in as many weeks. Of course that was not to be, and Italy received their customary pasting.
