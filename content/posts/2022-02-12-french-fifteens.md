Here’s another variation on Fifteens, this time with French beurré nantais and pâte de fruits.

Probably a bit on the sweet side, so to use up the condensed milk I had another go later in the week with cherries soaked in Chambord, and the other French biscuits from the deli. Think the alcohol helps cut through the sweetness ‘un petit peu’ and the bicuits may have had a slightly better texture.
