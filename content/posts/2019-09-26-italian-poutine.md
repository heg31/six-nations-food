### The game

**Date:** 26th September 2019
**Who was playing:** Italy v Canada
**What was the score:** 48-7

### The food

We dreamed this one up whilst eating poutine outside in the sunshine, in a Canadian-style brewpub in France. The poutine, and indeed the beer, was distinctly average. But with the world cup imminent we were inspired to give poutine a go for one of the Canada matches. A pool match obviously, it’s not like they were going to make it into the knockouts. And lo, they were convincingly thrashed even by Italy.

The Italy match was identified as the best candidate. So to Italian-ify the poutine, we decided to use mozzarella instead of cheese curds. We used a nice smoked mozzarella, with Essential Waitrose fries and some homemade gravy. It was all a bit soggy and unconvincing, although as chips n cheese with gravy goes, it was probably the fanciest we’ve ever had.
