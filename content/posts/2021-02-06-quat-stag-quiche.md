### The food

In the midst of miserable lockdown three, a shining beacon: the Six Nations. Something to do. Something actually... happening? So something to celebrate, with some nonsense cooking and maybe a glass of fizz.

The basic quiche recipe came from [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/quichelorraine_71987), but this was more than your standard Lorraine. The pastry got an additional hit of herbs (oregano and thyme), as well as a grating of parmesan. While the pastry was blind baking, a punnet of chestnut mushrooms were fried in butter, with some garlic, until most of the moisture had come out of the mushrooms. For the last 5 minutes of blind baking, a pack of proscuitto was torn up and thrown in with the mushrooms. These were then added to the pastry crust, along with chopped up cherry tomatoes, olives, and artichokes.

The egg/milk/cream (so much cream!) mixture was poured over the quartet of seasonal fillings, and then grated mozzarella was sprinkled over the top.

After about 40 minutes in the oven the quiche was ready, set, go.

A good chunk of quiche, with a glass of champagne to toast the start of another Six Nations tournament. The pastry was light and crisp, the filling really worked in quiche form, and France somewhat predictably annihilated Italy. *Tres bien!*
