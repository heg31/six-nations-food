### The game

**Date:** 13th March 2016
**Who was playing:** Scotland v France
**What was the score:** 29-18

### The food

Two desserts, both classic to their respective homelands. In the Gallic corner, [clafoutis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clafoutis), a baked batter studded with fruits, usually cherries. In the Gaelic corner, [cranachan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranachan), less a dessert and more a few things (whipped cream, whisky, raspberries and oats) mixed together. Can you do more with Scotland's top notch raspberries and whisky than simply dumping them in some cream? Like, say, baking them into some sort of French dessert, because it's Scotland versus France in the Six Nations and that's what we do around here.

The end result, much like the final score, was a roaring success. When it comes to the mechanics of making clafoutis, rather than consult a Frenchman we usually turn to fellow Scot [Tom Kitchin's](https://www.cooked.com/uk/Tom-Kitchin/Quadrille-Publishing/Kitchin-Suppers/Simple-desserts/Prune-clafoutis-recipe) recipe, substituting the prunes he advises for whatever takes our fancy. Raspberries make a fine, although slightly soggier, substitute for cherries or prunes, and a splash of whisky in the batter does not appear to compromise the dish's texture or ability to puff up nicely around the edges. The oats were added in the form of a crispy topping, made with sugar and rolled oats. Cream could be poured over the top if you feel tradition demands all four elements, or just if you're feeling particularly indulgent.
