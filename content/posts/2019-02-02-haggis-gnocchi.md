## The game

**Date:** 2nd February 2019
**Who was playing:** Scotland v Italy
**What was the score:** 33-20

## The food

Haggis and neeps, but with gnocchi instead of potatoes, in a whisky cream sauce. The cream sauce was good, made with a mixture of simmered down stock and cream rather than all cream so it was not quite as overwhelmingly rich.
