### The food

Just a friendly warm-up match between Scotland and Georgia, but momentous nonetheless, heralding the return of international rugby to the northern hemisphere after a 7 month hiaitus, and the return of bonkers fusion cookery to our kitchen.

Georgians, it turns out, enjoy a type of dumpling called khinkali. They're not too dissimilar to the [Russian pelmeni](/posts/2019-10-09-haggis-pelmeni/) we had made before. Although the two nations may have a different take on the specifics of the meat filling, we of course had our own ideas, and opted to fill them with haggis.

We took the dough recipe and method from [here](https://www.theworldwasherefirst.com/khinkali-recipe/), with a bit of assistance on folding technique from [this helpful video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYqLXV0hHtw/?hl=en). The filling was haggis. Literally just haggis. [Macsween](https://www.macsween.co.uk/) of course.

The folding was a bit trickier than the pelmeni! So the results were not quite as pleasingly neat as we'd managed before, although probably not too bad for a first attempt at a fiddly technique.

The khinkali are usually boiled for about 10 minutes to ensure that the dough and the meat filling, which is added raw, are cooked through. Although the haggis is technically cooked, we still gave the dumplings a good 10 minutes to ensure it was suitably hot.

If you make these with the traditional meat filling, the juices from the meat form a sort of broth inside the dumpling, and there is [a bit of a technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17aTl2R0OjU) for eating them successfully. Obviously that wasn't going to happen with haggis, so they needed some kind of sauce. We sat the dumplings on a traditional whisky cream sauce, which complemented them nicely.

**BONUS** The next day we had some leftover dumplings, so we fried them in butter. They ended up brown and crispy and made a fabulous brunch with a fried egg on the side.
