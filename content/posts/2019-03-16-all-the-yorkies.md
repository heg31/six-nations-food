### The food

In 2018 we had a [bit of a theme](/posts/2018-02-03-all-the-pies/) of making a different Scotch pie for each of Scotland's opponents. For 2019, newly emigrated to Yorkshire, in the interests of trying to assimilate we decided to practice our Yorkshire pudding skills by doing a Yorkie-based series for all of England's matches.

Our effort for the France match [has its own post here](/posts/2019-02-10-toulouse-cass-yorkies), so here's a round up of the others.

#### Rarebit Yorkies

When in doubt, fill things with melted cheese? A rarebit topping was assembled, using [Black Bomber cheese](https://www.welshcheesecompany.co.uk/product/black-bomber/) and a [Welsh red ale](https://www.tinyrebel.co.uk/beer/cwtch). This was poured into the puddings once they were almost cooked, and baking continued until everything was golden and melty.

#### Haggis Yorkies

Not thinking too far out of the box on this one; dump a load of haggis onto the Yorkies and pour over some whisky cream sauce.

#### Chocolate Guinness Yorkies

Who says the fillings need to be savoury? For Ireland's turn, a [light Guinness mousse](https://domestikatedlife.com/2021/03/03/easy-chocolate-guinness-mousse/) was spooned into cooled Yorkies. The final result was a bit messy to eat, but came out like a sort of light profiterole. Very nice.

#### Tiramisu Yorkies

Another sweet one - attempting to fill the Yorkie with the [boozy cream and mascarpone filling](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/best-ever-tiramisu) you might find in a Tiramisu, with a bit of coffee in the bottom. Unfortunately these were a bit soggy and it wasn't the best combination of flavours.
