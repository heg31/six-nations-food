### The food

Finally, a Wales combination that was not based on leeks (SPOILER it still involved leeks...).

On the way back from a trip to Wales, just before we crossed the border, we stopped at a Co-op to stock up on some local produce, and came away with the goods alright - bara brith, Traegar waffles, local beers, and... a tin of laverbread, because why not? We'd never actually tried it before, we just knew it was made of seaweed. Which is not necessarily a bad thing - we're nori fans in this household - and some googling also suggested it is [good for you](http://www.laverbread.org/health.html).

Clearly it had to feature in the next round of Six Nations Food. We had no specific plans for it when we bought it, but inspiration struck with an impending France match; what about laverbread quiche? Unfortunately, like other genius ideas, we did not get there first, in fact not even close
there are [so](http://www.laverbread.org/recipe.html#a) [many](https://stdavids.world/laverbread-the-story-and-the-recipes/) [recipes](http://www.parsonspickles.co.uk/recipes/#lquiche) [for](https://cookeatshare.com/recipes/laverbread-quiche-319563) laverbread quiche. We mostly went with [this one](https://businesswales.gov.wales/foodanddrink/sites/foodanddrink/files/documents/Welsh%20Laverbread%20%28PDO%29%20%26%20Cockle%20Quiche.pdf), cross referencing with a trusted [Mary Berry quiche recipe](https://www.lovefood.com/recipes/59635/mary-berrys-quiche-lorraine-recipe).

The recipes differed wildly on how much laverbread to add to your quiche; some chucked in a whole tin, others were more restrained. After an initial taste suggested the flavour was not as strong as we feared, we decided to go for the whole tin, because what else were we going to do with it? This was a good move - it seemed like the right amount in the finished product. As well as laverbread, the quiche contained grated Black Bomber cheese and some softened leeks.

It's not a flavour sensation like [quattro stagioni quiche](/posts/2021-02-06-quat-stag-quiche/), but it is tasty. It's quite subtle, but the richness of all the eggs, cheese and butter is nicely offset by the almost aggressively healthy green-ness of the laverbread. You'd get a similar effect from some heavily wilted spinach or greens, but then it wouldn't be as Welsh.
