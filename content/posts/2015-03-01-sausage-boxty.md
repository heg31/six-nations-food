### The game

**Date:** 1st March 2015
**Who was playing:** Ireland v England
**What was the score:** 19-9

### The food

Classic English sausages with traditional Irish potato pancakes and plenty of gravy.

There's really only one way to cook sausages with gravy - the Nigel Slater method. Brown the sausages and set aside. Soften onions in butter for 30-40 minutes (yes that long). Sprinkle over a little flour, then add some liquid (stock, ale, wine, etc), some aromatics (juniper is nice) and a spoonful of mustard. Nestle the sausages in the liquid and cook in the oven for about 40 minutes. You end up with a lovely tasty gravy, and not a Bisto granule in sight.
