**What was the score:** 23-21

### The food

Without doubt one of our finest creations. The inspiration came from a TV show. Monica Galetti was in some French gaff where they were making ‘morbiflette’; like [tartiflette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartiflette), but with [morbier cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbier_cheese). We wondered whether this might work with the potatoes substituted out for potato gnocchi, and our instincts were entirely correct.

It’s pretty simple. Brown off the pancetta. Fry onions in butter until soft and melty, add flour and cook it out for a bit, then add white wine and cream to make the sauce. Add (cooked) gnocchi and the pancetta to the sauce, chuck it in a dish and top with slices of morbier. Bake until melty and bubbly.

It was a tenuous victory for France in the rugby, but a storming victory for the morbiflette. This dish is not good for your health, but presumably that's why it tastes so good. Go for a brisk walk or something. It's worth it. Did we mention it's good?
