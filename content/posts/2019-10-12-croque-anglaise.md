**Date:** 12th October 2019
**Who was playing:** England v France
**What was the score:** Cancelled!

### The food

Some ideas are so stupid they just have to happen. Even though the match itself was cancelled due to a typoon, this ridiculous sandwich went ahead. The sandwich that addresses the question nobody wants the answer to: what if you took a croque madame, but instead of plain old ham and cheese in the middle, you shoved a full English breakfast in there? It can be done. It was done. Whether it should have been done, or anyone should attempt to repeat it is another matter.

A sandwich was constructed with sausage, bacon, black pudding, mushrooms and beans. And a hint of dijon mustard *bien sur*.

 The resulting monstrosity of a sandwich was topped with a few oven roasted tomatoes, bechamel sauce and cheese, and grilled. Finally it was topped off with a fried egg.

 It was every bit as filthy as you might imagine. You will not feel good after eating this sandwich. But in some way you will feel like a winner.
