### The game

**Date:** 9th February 2019
**Who was playing:** Italy v Wales
**What was the score:** 15-26

### The food

The hackneyed combination of leek and caerphilly had been employed previously in focaccia form, but never in a pasta dish. A bechamel sauce was enhanced with some leeks, braised until soft, and some caerphilly cheese. We also tossed a few peas in there for a bit of extra geenery. The pasta bake was topped with breadcrumbs for a nice crispy crunch.
