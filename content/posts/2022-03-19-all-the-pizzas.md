### The game

**Dates:** 6th February (France), 13th February (England), 27th February (Ireland), 11th March (Scotland), 19th March (Wales)
**Who was playing:** Italy vs the others
**What was the score:** Mostly thumped but they beat Wales in Wales!

### The food

For the 2022 Six Nations we decided to make a different pizza for every Italy match. Endlessly versatile, there are many ways you can take a pizza and make it your own. And that is what we did.

We used the [Jamie Oliver pizza dough recipe](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/bread-recipes/pizza-dough/) for all the pizzas, using the special 00 flour as directed.

They all turned out a messy oblong shape because a) rolling them out round/prettily is really hard and b) our baking trays are rectangular. We don't have a pizza oven so they just had to go in the regular oven on its hottest setting.


#### Week 1: France

The idea for this one was better than the reality. What is French... ooh snails! Let's put those on a galic bread pizza, that will be nice. We weren't the first to have such ideas; [snail](https://www.justapinch.com/recipes/main-course/french/pizzette-descargot-snail-pizza.html) [pizza](https://www.the-man-cooks.com/escargot-pizza/) and [snail garlic bread](https://czechthatout.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/round-flat-bread-topped-with-snails-and-garlic-butter/) has been done. But it wasn't nice. I mean, if you really love snails it might work for you. But for normal people it just tasted like disgusting snails on garlic bread.

#### Week 2: England

What about a Sunday lunch on a pizza? No? Well we did it and it was pretty good. All the roasty stuff (beef, yorkies, roasties) was cooked up in a roast dinner the previous day. The leftovers then went on a pizza, with some caramalised onion instead of tomato, but still with some mozzarella, and a bit of horseradish sauce sprinkled over once it was done.

#### Week 3: Ireland

This pizza needed potatoes, obviously. But we paired these with some Irish blue cheese, and it makes for a pretty magnificent pizza topping (carb on carb, mmmm).

#### Week 4: Scotland

For Scotland's week we made two pizzas. A veggie haggis one, which surprisingly we hadn't done before, no idea why because it was fantastic. And for pudding we attemped a repeat of the fairly disastrous [sweet Scottish pizza](posts/2018-03-17-tunnocks-pizza/) (no actual Teacakes this time, just raspberry sauce, marshmallows and chocolate), which actually turned out a bit better than the last one.

#### Week 5: Wales

This was a special one. On a trip to actual Welsh Wales, we stopped off on the way home to pick up some genuine Welsh lamb. Said lamb went in a pot with some Welsh beer, stock and vegetables, and cooked slowly in the oven for a very long time, until it was super soft and falling apart.

The meat was teased apart with forks and became a pizza topping, along with some braised leeks, tomato sauce, and smoked mozzarella.
