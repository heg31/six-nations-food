### The game

**Date:** 26th March 2021
**Who was playing:** France v Scotland
**What was the score:** 23-27

### The food

This game was rescheduled to six days *after* Super Saturday, as it had to be postponed due to a Covid outbreak among the French players and staff, who decided to go out for waffles instead of observing protocol. Pas cool, lads.

We hadn't originally planned anything too exciting for this match, which was due to be the weekend's Sunday afternoon fixture. We made it anyway, and ate it sans rugby - a croissant with haggis and some cream (blue) cheese.

However, the reschedule presented an excuse for a second crack at the whip. An evening game - so what to have for dinner? We settled on a souffle, having not attempted one since a leek and caerphilly version [many years ago](/posts/2015-02-28-leek-caerphilly-souffle). The man to consult on such matters is obviously Raymond Blanc, who can be seen making a souffle in [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLj4L4PWsrc) of his TV series from a few years ago (about 13 and a half minutes in). It's an absolutely charming sequence, complete with cheese tasting, wine glugging, and of course a step by step souffle masterclass. The exact recipe is not on the BBC Food website, but a very similar one can be found [here](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/comte-cheese-souffle).

In a nod to Scotland, this one would feature Scottish Isle of Mull cheddar (pretty much the only Scottish cheese you can get around these parts) in place of Comte, and substitute the kirsch in the sauce for a peaty single malt. Would that even work??

Oh it worked. Mull cheddar easily matches Comte in the flavour stakes, and the whisky sauce had a lovely smoky kick. Unlike some of our fusions, the substitute ingredients did not obliterate the original concept. The souffle was exactly as a souffle should be - light and elegant and cheesy - but the unusual ingredients gave it a distinctive Scottish feel. The French, cheese masters that they are, do not make anything like a Mull cheddar, and obviously they do not make whisky.

Served with a salad, and a glass of French white wine, as insisted upon by Monsieur Blanc. The rugby was almost as delicious as the souffle, with Scotland grabbing a try in the dying moments of the game to take the win. What is French for karma?
