### What's the big deal with Super Saturday?

It's like Christmas, but better because there is rugby. So much rugby. And in honour of this great day, the Super Saturday Smorgasbord.

### What are the key elements of the Super Saturday Smorgasbord(TM)?

1. **Cheese**
  This is key. A visit to a local purveyor of cheese (such as [Mellis](https://www.mellischeese.net/)) for sampling and advice is an important and very enjoyable ritual. You will need at least one cheese per nation, but you can of course have more than one.

2. **Bread and crackers**
  For said cheese. Feel free to throw in other things that go with your carby delights such as pates and dips.

3. **Sweet things**
  Representatives of the various nations, e.g. Welsh cakes, Tunnocks tea cakes, French patisserie.

4. **Booze**
  Much like Christmas, it is absolutely fine to crack into the prosecco at midday.
