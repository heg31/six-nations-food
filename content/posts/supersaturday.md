### What's the big deal with Super Saturday?

It's like Christmas, but better because there is rugby. So much rugby. And in honour of this great day, the Super Saturday Smorgasbord.

### What are the key elements of the Super Saturday Smorgasbord(TM)?

**Cheese**
This is key. A visit to a local purveyor of cheese (such as [Mellis](https://www.mellischeese.net/)) for sampling and advice is an important and very enjoyable ritual. You will need at least one cheese per nation, but you can of course have more than one.

**Bread and crackers**
For said cheese. Feel free to throw in other things that go with your carby delights such as pates and dips.

**Sweet things**
Representatives of the various nations, e.g. Welsh cakes, Tunnocks tea cakes, French patisserie.

**Booze**
Much like Christmas, it is absolutely fine to crack into the fizz at midday. And save your DIPAs and your imperial stouts; today of all days, it's all about the session beers.

It really is the most wonderful time of the year.
