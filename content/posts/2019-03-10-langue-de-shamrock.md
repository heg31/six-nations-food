### The food

Oh dear. A nice idea that didnâ€™t quite go to plan. You know [langues de chat](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/langues_de_chat_biscuits_51182) - the delicate little french biscuits you might get on the side of your coffee? Yeah. Well what if they were...green...and shamrock shaped??

In the end the colour was just very unappetising, and they spread so much in the oven that any resemblance to a shamrock was purely coincidental. They tasted ok though.
