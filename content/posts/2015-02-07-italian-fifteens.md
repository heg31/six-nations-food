### The food

I love Fifteens! Although I didn’t know of Fifteens till I was a student I’ve had a very similar ‘fridge cake’ made by my mum since I was a wee lad. For this Italian spin on the classic the digestives have been replaced with amaretti biscuits and the glace cherries with amarena cherries. Needless to say this is a delicious variation that will have to be made again. There has also been a [Scottish version](posts/2019-02-09-scottish-fifteens).
