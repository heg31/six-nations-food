### The food

After seven years of making Six Nations fusion food, it's rare to come across a dish that hasn't come up before as we trawl the internet to find the quintessential dishes and ingredients that represent each country. However, the Welsh onion cake was a new one.

A what? Well for one thing it's really more of a potato dish, although onions feature heavily, as well as a leek of course. Thinly sliced potatoes are layered up in a dish - so far, so dauphinoise - except instead of cream or stock poured over the top, the only liquid content is a bucketload of butter, and really soft onions. The French would be proud. Cheese is not compulsory, but we followed [this recipe](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/welsh-onion-cake-caerphilly) which crumbles some Caerphilly among the layers, and this is to be recommended.

It was a good excuse to get the mandolin out, and if you can avoid slicing your fingers it's a doddle to assemble. But the cooking is trickier. There's a fine balance between cooking it and burning it, and covering it with foil prevents the latter but really slows down the former! It probably depends on what potatoes you use, but for us it was the best part of two hours before the potatoes didn't feel suspiciously raw.

If you can wait that long it is worth it; the final result is as good as you would expect a dish of buttery, cheesy potatoes to be, with a nice crispy crust on top. As it's all Welsh, as a nod to England we ate it with some Cumberland sausages.
