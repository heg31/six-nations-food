### The game

**Date:** 9th February 2019
**Who was playing:** Scotland v Ireland
**What was the score:** 13-22

### The food

Had to have a go at making a Scottish version of these, following up from the [Italian version](/posts/2015-02-07-italian-fifteens). This time digestives are replaced with Scottish shortbread and whisky soaked raisins take the place of some of the cherries.
