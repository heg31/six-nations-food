### The game

**Date:** 9th March 2013
**Who was playing:** Scotland v Wales
**What was the score:** 18-28 :(

### The food

A fairly simple substitution this one, leeks were brought in to replace neeps. There was also some Penderyn Whisky added to the accompanying cream sauce (*Welsh whisky?? Sacrilege! But also rather nice*).
