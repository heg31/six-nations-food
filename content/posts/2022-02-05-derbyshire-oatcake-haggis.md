### The food

And you thought oatcakes were Scottish. Well, we did, until a visit to a Peak District cafe alerted us to these English impostors. More flexible than their crunchy Scottish namesake, they are more of an oaty pancake. And they make not just a terrific post sub-zero hiking snack, but also a fine canvas for creating some fusions.

Some Googling revealed that they have a bitter rival in the form of the Staffordshire oatcake, which seems to be very much the same thing, maybe a bit thinner? But like all hyper-local and meaningless rivalries, this one is intense, with insults hurled in all directions at each county's respective offering.

There are more Staffordshire oatcake recipes on the internets (maybe they are winning?) but there are a few for Derbyshire oatcakes too - like [this one](https://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/features/2002/10/oatcakes.shtml), and [this one](http://www.dailyrecipes.co/recipe/derbyshire-oatcakes/) and [this one](https://recipeland.com/recipe/v/derbyshire-oatcakes-21899). They vary slightly but basically all say the same thing; you need equal quantities of oatmeal and flour, plus yeast, salt, sugar and milk and/or water. The recipes generally call for fine oatmeal, but we had some medium, which we blitzed up a bit and it worked fine. We used a mix of wholemeal and white (bread) flour. Boiling water and cold milk give you a nice lukewarm liquid in which to put your yeast and sugar to get it going. The batter is whisked into a thin yeasty gruel which you leave to sit for a bit while you do other things and it will foam up nicely.

To cook, grease a pan with butter and pour in a ladleful, and cook for a couple of minutes on each side until brown. And then fill! In the case of the Calcutta, with haggis and a sharp English cheddar. From the recipe it looks like they might be a bit worthy/hard work to eat but they're actually quite light and delicious, and go perfectly with haggis. A fine snack to accompany a narrow but glorious victory.
