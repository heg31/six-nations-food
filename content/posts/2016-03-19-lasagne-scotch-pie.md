### The food

Love a scotch pie, but can't be bothered to make hot water crust pastry? Good news! You can order the empty cases [online](https://www.diyscotchpie.co.uk/). And while you could fill them with some [traditional mutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_pie), you also have a blank canvas for some very silly cooking.

If you've set foot inside a Scottish bakery you'll be familiar with a macaroni pie, but what other pasta dishes could you fill a scotch pie with? Lasagne is a firm favourite of ours so we gave that a go. Standard components - beef mince ragu, bechamel sauce, mozzarella cheese. Fresh lasagne sheets are a must though, so you can cut them into circles that fit the pie cases. It's a bit time consuming and fiddly to layer them up but so worth it.

Bake until golden brown and bubbling (maybe half an hour?). Enjoy.
