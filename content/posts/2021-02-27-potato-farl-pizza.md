### The food

How about we use potato farls as a pizza base? Ok then, let's give it a go.

Bake until cheese is bubbling and golden, serve with a garnish of fresh basil.

Conclusion was that it was a bit of fun to try, but not as good as a regular base. A little too thick and stodgy, perhaps a Scottish tattie scone would fare better... or maybe they're best saved for breakfast. Still, kept us going for the match, which was a little one sided.
