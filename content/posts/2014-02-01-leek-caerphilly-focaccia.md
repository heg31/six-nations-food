### The game

**Date:** 1st February 2014
**Who was playing:** Wales v Italy
**What was the score:** 23 v 15

### The food

Leek and Caerphilly crop up in a lot of our recipes involving Wales, but they work so well in a number of different formats. Here we created a focaccia to snack on during the game, which puffed up a bit more than expected but was tasty nonetheless.
