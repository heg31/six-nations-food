### The game

**Dates:** 3rd February (Wales), 11th February (France), 24th February (England), 10th March (Ireland), 17th March (Italy)
**Who was playing:** Scotland vs... everyone!
**What was the score:** Lost horribly to Wales and Ireland but **WE WON THE CALCUTTA SO WHO CARES**

### The food

We'd successfully made a [lasagne pie previously](/posts/2016-03-19-lasagne-scotch-pie/), for a Scotland versus Italy match, but for 2018 we decided to make it a theme and do a whole series of pies, one for each of Scotlandâ€™s matches. So we just needed a filling pertaining to each of the countries.

#### Leek and Caerphilly Scotch Pie

One for the veggies, but only if you use a pastry case that isn't made with lard I guess... Braised leeks with cream, mustard and crumbled caerphilly.

#### Coq au Vin Scotch Pie

Classic coq au vin - chicken, pancetta, carrot and mushrooms, throw in a bouquet garni and simmer in red wine for about half an hour. You need to thicken/reduce the sauce a bit more than you might normally, just so it doesn't soak the pastry cases.

#### Sausage and Mash Scotch Pie

Oi oi saveloy. Sausages cooked in gravy [the usual way](/posts/2015-03-01-sausage-boxty/). Mash on top, bake, voila.

#### Irish Stew Scotch Pie

A standard lamb and vegetable stew (not sure what claim it has to be Irish to be honest). Again you might want to thicken the sauce up a bit for pie purposes. A circular potato on top goes golden brown in the oven and looks nice.

#### Melanzane Scotch Pie

A departure from the usual pasta and meat based Italian fillings, we went for [Melanzane alla Parmigiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigiana). Roasted aubergine, tomato sauce and mozzarella actually makes for a pretty good pie filling - enough moisture but not too much, holds together well.
