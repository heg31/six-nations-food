### The game

**Date:** 22nd September 2019
**Who was playing:** Scotland v Ireland
**What was the score:** 27-3

### The food

A world cup on the other side of the world means that matches happen early. Too early for massive platefulls of food or mountains of cheese. So that means trying to find fusion dishes more suitable for breakfast.

This one seems like the sort of thing you might get for brunch in a hipster-y sort of cafe with smashed avocados and expensive coffee. The boxty recipe was courtesy of [actual Irish person Donal Skehan](http://www.donalskehan.com/recipes/boxty-irish-potato-pancakes/) and came out surprisingly light, with the raw potato cooked through before the whole thing burned, which seems like a miracle. Served with haggis and a fried egg. A delightful brunch, a less delightful scoreline.
