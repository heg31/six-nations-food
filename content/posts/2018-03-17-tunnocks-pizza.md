### The game

**Date:** 17th March 2018
**Who was playing:** Italy v Scotland
**What was the score:** 27-29 (almost as disastrous as the pizza)

### The food

To round off Six Nations 2018, the Year Of All The Pies, we made an [Italian themed scotch pie](/posts/2018-02-03-all-the-pies/) for this match. However, as it was Super Saturday, we decided to make a wee bonus item - a sweet pizza. Regular pizza base, topped with raspberry coulis, mini marshmallows and Tunnocks teacakes.

Unfortunately it turned out that teacakes do **not** enjoy being in a very hot oven, and they went from initially looking nice and melty to the chocolate being absolutely burnt to a cinder before the pizza was even cooked.

But we scraped off the burnt bits and ate the rest, which was still good. Next time (there will be one!) we just need to add the teacakes at the very last minute, perhaps about 30 seconds before the end.
