### The food

Yet another outing for the leek and Caerphilly pairing, topping a croissant this time (we were slightly surprised we'd never done this one before). A fair amount of butter is involved. Braise leeks in butter, and stick them on an all butter croissant with some caerphilly. Finish in the oven to melt.
