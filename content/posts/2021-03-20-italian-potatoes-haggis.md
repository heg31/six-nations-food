### The game

**Date:** 20th March 2021
**Who was playing:** Scotland v Italy
**What was the score:** 52-10

### The food

The Super Saturday Smorgasbord is a thing of beauty, but unfortunately man cannot live on bread and cheese alone. Three rugby matches' worth of alcohol consumption demands something a little more substantial at some point during proceedings. This year the festivities were kicked off by Scotland and Italy, so some kind of Scotalian lunch seemed like a good plan.

We didn't really want to do pizza or pasta, so started casting around for other ideas. Do Italians do anything specifically with potatoes? A google search yielded many results for 'Italian' roast potatoes, which seemed to constitute adding rosemary and parmesan to a standard tray of roasties. No idea if this is actually an Italian thing or just something that people describe as such, but it seemed like a nice idea anyway.

The roast potatoes were loaded up with haggis and arrabbiata sauce, like some sort of unholy Scotalian patatas bravas.[^1] More like Patate **Braveheart** eh? Eh?? Ahem. I'll get my coat.

The resulting dish is not the prettiest thing, but it's damn tasty. Potatoes are a standard pairing for haggis, and we knew from [previous nonsense](/posts/2014-02-22-haggis-balls-spaghetti/) that a tomato sauce is a good accompaniment too. Perfect to line the stomach for another glorious Super Saturday.
