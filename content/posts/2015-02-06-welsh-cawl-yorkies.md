### The game

**Date:** 6th February 2015
**Who was playing:** Wales v England
**What was the score:** 16 v 21

### The food

Stew in Yorkshire Puddings, what’s not to love on a cold February evening. The 2015 Six Nations kicked off with a Friday night game in Wales, so something hearty and Welsh was on the menu for dinner. Wikipedia informed us that [cawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Welsh_dishes) is Wales’ national dish so we plumped for that, poured into a classic English Yorkshire pudding.
