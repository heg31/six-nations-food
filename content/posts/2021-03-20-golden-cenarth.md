### The game

**Date:** 20th March 2021
**Who was playing:** France v Wales
**What was the score:** 32-30

### The food

This was really just part of this year's [Super Saturday Smorgasbord](/posts/supersaturday/), but it somehow seems worthy of a post since it was a combo for the final game of the day, and is pretty much a meal in its own right. If you haven't yet discovered Golden Cenarth then we would highly recommend tracking it down, usually in Waitrose and sometimes M&S. Stick it in the oven for 20 minutes and enjoy! By this point on Super Saturday we had moved on from beers to a bottle of French wine, which went wonderfully well with this combo and brought out a honey flavour from the cheese, or did the cheese bring out a honey flavour from the wine... Perhaps it doesn't matter.
