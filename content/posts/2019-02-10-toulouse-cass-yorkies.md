**Who was playing:** England v France
**What was the score:** 44-8

### The food

A hearty casserole of Toulouse sausages and lentils is a staple around here, but a France match is always a good excuse to break it out.

It's a simple dish and the payoff to effort ratio is high. Brown some Toulouse sausages and set aside. Crisp up some bacon lardons, then add in onions, garlic, carrots and celery, and saute until soft. Add the sausages back in, along with a generous glass of red wine, some green lentils (I like to parboil them for 10 minutes first) and a [bouquet garni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouquet_garni) (I buy these in a ready-to-go teabag format from a well known spice brand, shhh don't tell the French). Simmer until the lentils are tender and the sausages are cooked through (usually about 40 minutes).

We had planned to serve the casserole in a Yorkshire pudding. However, our Yorkie skills are still far from perfect, and the craggy, spherical results of tonight's attempts would not have held so much as a lentil in them. Still, they were nice on the side.

A miserable scoreline ensued, but consolation was available in sausage form.
